# Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software
My solutions to code problems in Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software Course at Duke University offered at Coursera.org

About this Course
Learn to code in Java and improve your programming and problem-solving skills. You will learn to design algorithms as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open-source classes, you will write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data. At the end of the course you will build a program that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files.

Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
Use Java API documentation in writing programs.
Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.
Important Note
Some code could be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the University website here.
